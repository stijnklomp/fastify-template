- Jest: Unit & Feature testing framework for ensuring code quality and functionality.
- Playwright: Integration testing framework for comprehensive testing of user interactions and browser behavior.
- Husky: Git hooks for running linting and tests before commits, ensuring code quality standards are met.
- TypeDoc: Automatic generation of TypeScript documentation for improved code clarity and collaboration.

## Installation

```sh
npm ci
```

## Prerequisites

Create a `.env` file in the root directory if one does not already exist and copy the contents of the desired environment file over. (`.env.development` or `.env.production`)

## Running the app

```sh
# Development in watch mode
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm run build && npm run start
```

### With Docker

```sh
docker build -t fastify-template . && docker run --rm fastify-template
```

### With Docker Compose

```sh
# There are multiple profiles that can be run:
# dev -> Mounts the current directory to the container and runs the service in watch mode
# local -> Builds and runs the application image from the current code
docker compose --profile=PROFILE up --build
```

#### Database

The database can be accessed via a browser by navigating to `API_URL:8080` when running Docker Compose with the `dev` profile.

Note that you may need to run `npx prisma migrate dev --name init` in your terminal if you haven't already initialized the database. This only needs to be done the first time the database is created. (Or whenever the database has been recreated) This will happen automatically when using any profile in Docker Compose.

## Endpoints documentation (API specification)

Once the app is running, documentation will be available at `API_URL:PORT/docs`.

## Test

### Unit & Feature tests

```sh
# Unit tests
npm run test

# Feature tests
npm run test:feature

# Test coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Integration tests

```sh
npm run test:integration
```

#### With Docker Compose

```sh
# Run once and exit
docker compose --profile=test up --build --attach integration-once --exit-code-from integration-once

# Run multiple times
# There are multiple profiles that can be run for the integration tests:
# dev
# local
docker compose --profile=PROFILE up --build -d && docker compose --profile=PROFILE exec -ti dev sh -c "npm run test:integration"
```
